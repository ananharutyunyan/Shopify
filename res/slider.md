# Slider

## Two Layouts

### Desktop:
* very minimal lightbox
* fade in place
* no next/prev
* grid at bottom


### Mobile
#### Start:
* same as desktop

#### Zoomed
* full screen
* vertical swipe or horizontal swipe, with appropriate matching animation
* double tap to toggle zoom/pan
* bottom 1-row slider, with simple left-right scrolling, syncing with fancybox


# Plan
1. Go through Fancybox docs, to know what it can do
2. Implement basic desktop as is with pure fancybox
  * use <a> layout
  * use data-srcset  [example](https://codepen.io/fancyapps/pen/YQKKYx?editors=1000)
  * use data-height & data-width
  * simple grid at bottom?
  *
